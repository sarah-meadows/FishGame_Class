Thank you for purchasing this Halftone Shader Pack. In this pack you will find 10 shaders (5 with normal maps and 5 without) 
along with 20 different textures that can be supplied to the ‘Halftone_Texture’ parameter. There are also materials for the 
shaders already set to some pleasing values. 

We’ve included a demo scene where you can see what each of the properties do for 2 specified models.

If you have any questions or feedback please send them to support@radicalforge.com with ‘Halftone Shaders’ as the subject.
